Heart Disease Prediction using Logistic Regression ❤️📊
This repository contains all the necessary files and documentation for the Heart Disease Prediction project, which utilizes Logistic Regression for its predictions.

🎯 Objective
The objective of this project is to leverage machine learning to predict the likelihood of a patient having heart disease.

📂 Data
The dataset used in this project comes from the Framingham Heart Study and includes various patient metrics such as age, sex, cholesterol levels, and more.

🧹🔧 Data Preprocessing
This stage involves cleaning the data, handling missing values, and performing exploratory data analysis.

🛠️🔮 Modeling
The Logistic Regression model is trained using the processed dataset.

🧮🔍 Evaluation
Model performance is evaluated using a confusion matrix, ROC curve, and other classification metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

📈📊 Results
The results section discusses the model's performance, significant predictors, and other insights derived from the model.

💡⚖️ Implications
This section discusses the real-world implications of the model's predictions and its utility in healthcare.
